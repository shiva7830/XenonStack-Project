 we also use a mysql database by which we can store the data of any client when we register on our website 
 and we also use API token to store the data of our client on one place . We also assign a API token those who register 
 ourselves on our website for decrease chaos we made two types of registration first one for those who want only 
 pg and second one those who want car on rent. We also share some screenshot how we use token with the
 help of API
